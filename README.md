# hosted-game-servers

Servers that have been hosted for multiplayer games (intended to be a reference for future instances).

Most games that you can host on your own server these days has a pretty easy path forward using 
an existing dockerfile, minus configuration and customization. 

All the folders in this repo include anything that was/is needed to get the game running as desired. 
Which usually means some mods and some extra settings. 

Nothing in here should be expected to work as-is though. 
These configs worked at least once at some point in time, 
but with no thought to maintenance or good sense. 

Treat these as starting points for anything you try to do.
